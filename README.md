# Synyin Deed

# General
Synteny Index (SI) is a newly-developed method for genetic alignment of organisms. It has been proved to be more accurate (in certain conditions) than sequence-based approaches. That is, for prokaryotes (Bacteria & Archea).
I've been developing Syntin Deed as part of a study, which undermines to find out whether SI is also as good for eukaryotes (All other organisms) genetic comparisons.

# How to use?
Download the program to your desktop and run "run.bat".
You should see something like this:

"Covnert" and "Analyze" are essentials. The rest are quality-of-life functions.
Press the number of category of commands that you want to choose. For example: Enter '1' to enter the "Convert" category.


1. Convert:

1. GFF3 & FASTA -> GENELIST2: This is the first essential command. A .genelist2 file is a special type of file that you can then apply the SI algorithm to.
This function takes 4 files: The GFF and FASTA of each genome. Put those of the first genome in Main_Input/File 1 and those of the second one in Main_Input/File 2, then choose this command in console.

Output:
All output files are generated in Main_Output folder.
