# Synyin Deed

Synteny Index (SI) is a newly-developed method for genetic alignment of organisms. It has been proved to be more accurate (in certain conditions) than sequence-based approaches. That is, for prokaryotes (Bacteria & Archea).
I've been developing Syntin Deed as part of a study, which undermines to find out whether SI is also as good for eukaryotes (All other organisms) genetic comparisons.
